# Quantify business value

This article helps you understand the **Quantify business value** domain within the FinOps Framework and how to implement its capabilities in the Microsoft Cloud.

This domain is focused on identifying and breaking down cost, usage, and carbon emissions to establish and stay aligned with organizational plans and measure the return on investment from cloud computing efforts. This domain is all about measuring and maximizing the business value each team and workload gets from the cloud in an effort to maximize future potential.

## Planning and estimating

Planning and estimating refers to the process of estimating the cost and usage of new and existing workloads based on exploratory or planned architectural changes and evolving business priorities. With this capability, you will establish baseline expectations for new cloud workloads and prepare for changes to existing workloads. This capability is an important part of establishing and maintaining organizational budgets.

To learn more, see [Planning and estimating](./planning.md).

## Forecasting

Forecasting involves analyzing historical trends and future plans to predict costs, understand the impact on current budgets, and influence future budgets. With this capability, you will project future cost, usage, and carbon emissions based on historical trends. This capability is a major part of establishing accurate budgets for each team.

To learn more, see [Forecasting](./forecasting.md).

## Budgeting

Budgeting refers to the process of overseeing and tracking financial plans and limits over a given period to effectively manage and control spending. With this capability, you will utilize established estimates and forecasts to allocate funds to each team within the organization for fiscal year planning and configure alerts to drive accountability of those budgets. This capability plays a key role in staying within established fiscal constraints on an ongoing basis.

To learn more, see [Budgeting](./budgeting.md).

## Benchmarking

Benchmarking is a systematic process of evaluating the performance and value of cloud services using efficiency metrics, either within an organization or against industry peers. With this capability, you will measure and track key performance indicators to identify and accelerate adoption of successful initiatives that help maximize cloud ROI across teams and with external organizations, when available.

To learn more, see [Benchmarking](./benchmarking.md).

## Unit economics

Unit economics refers to the process of calculating the cost and carbon emissions of a single unit of a business that can show the business value of the cloud. With this capability, you will break down cost, usage, and carbon emissions and compare that with the business value per unit to identify high- and low-value workloads. This capability helps you identify areas that can be scaled out to accelerate business value through specific technology decisions.

To learn more, see [Unit economics](./unit-economics.md).
