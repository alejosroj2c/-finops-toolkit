The Microsoft FinOps toolkit advisory council represents contributors, their contributions, and end consumers for each of the tools and resources included in the FinOps toolkit. The advisory council advocates for diverse perspectives and fosters a collaborative environment, bridging the gap between the governing board and the contributors and consumers. Advisory council members are typically owners of one or more tools and resources that have been contributed to the FinOps toolkit.

- **Oversight**: Reviewing and providing feedback on board decisions.
- **Communication**: Facilitating open and transparent communication between the governing board, contributors, and consumers.

## 🤔 Making decisions

While the council does not make explicit project decisions amongst themselves, their participation in [[governing board]] meetings and decisions is subject to the same decision making process and requirements.

<br>

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Composition

The advisory council includes 1 and only 1 representative for each of the tools and resources included in the toolkit. The limit of 1 per tool or resource is to ensure the council remains fair, balanced, and does not grow too large to be effective. Learning resources split into collections of related content (e.g., marketing content vs. FinOps Framework docs).

Individuals must meet the following criteria in order to attain a council seat:

1. Must be an owner or appointed by an owner of a tool or resource that has shipped in the toolkit.
2. Must have detailed knowledge about the tool or resource to support consulting, technical support, or customer conversations, if needed.
3. Must engage with the community at least once per week, including customer calls.
4. Must dedicate and average of 2-4 hours per week to evolve, support, and evangelize their tool or resource.
5. Must participate in council meetings and discussions (synchronously or asynchronously).
6. Must attend at least one office hours per month.
7. Should be a FinOps Certified Practitioner.
8. Must attain a supermajority (two-thirds) board vote with no objections.
