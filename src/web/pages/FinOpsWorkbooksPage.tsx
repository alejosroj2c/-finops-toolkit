      <p>
        FinOps workbooks are Azure Monitor workbooks that provide a series of tools to help engineers perform targeted FinOps capabilities, modeled after the Well-Architected Framework guidance.
      </p>
      <p>This template includes the following workbooks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="./optimization/README.md">Optimization</a></li>
        <li><a href="./governance/README.md">Governance</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>‚ûï Deploy the Workbooks</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Ensure you have the following least-privileged roles to deploy and use the workbook:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Workbook Contributor</strong> ‚Äì allows you to deploy the workbook.</li>
          <li><strong>Reader</strong> ‚Äì view all of the workbook tabs.</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          If you only have read access, you can still import your workbook directly into Azure Monitor. You will not be able to save it, but you can view all tabs.
