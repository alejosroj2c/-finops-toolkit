      <h2>âž• Deploy the Workbook</h2>
      <p>
        Follow these steps to deploy the cost optimization workbook:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Ensure you have the following least-privileged roles to deploy and use the workbook:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Workbook Contributor</strong> â€“ allows you to deploy the workbook.</li>
          <li><strong>Reader</strong> â€“ view all of the workbook tabs.</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          If you only have read access, you can still import your workbook directly into Azure Monitor. You will not be able to save it, but you can view all tabs.
        </blockquote>
        <li>
          Deploy the <strong>optimization-workbook</strong> template.{' '}
