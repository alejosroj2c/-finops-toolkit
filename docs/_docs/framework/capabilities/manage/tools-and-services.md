It's important to understand the difference between a FinOps tools and a service, which are key elements in FinOps capabilities. A FinOps tool is a software package that helps you support any capability and can be used at a specific activity lever or a scope of cloud usage. A FinOps Service is a third party service that delivers an outcome related to the FinOps capability, these can be training, consultancy or manage services. 

The existent tools and services available to assist organizations with FinOps capabilities are diverse and growing. Organizations should develop a strategy to guide the use of tools and services.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting started

Implementation of this capability is highly dependent on how your organization has adopted each of the following frameworks and methodologies and what tools you've selected for each. See the following articles for details:

Be familiar with tools available in Microsoft Cloud. The following tools can help you gain visibility on usage and cloud spend to perform informed decisions:

- **Microsoft Cost Management**: A suite of tools designed to help organizations monitor, allocate, and optimize their cloud costs within the Microsoft Cloud.
- **Azure Monitor**: A comprehensive monitoring solution for collecting, analysing, and responding to monitoring data from your cloud and on-premises environments.  
- **Pricing Calculator**: Helps you configure and estimate the costs for Azure products and features based on specific scenarios.  
- **TCO Calculator**: Allows you to estimate the cost savings achievable by migrating your application workloads to Microsoft Cloud.  
- **Azure Resource Manager**: Lets you define, organize, categorize, and control your resources in a declarative template.  
- **Power BI**: A tool that turns data into insights and creates powerful reports.  
- **Azure Migrate**: Provides a simplified migration, modernization, and optimization service for Microsoft Cloud.

The next tools can be used to optimize your cloud rate and service configurations:

- **Azure Advisor**: Helps you follow best practices to optimize your Microsoft Cloud deployments.  
- **Azure Hybrid Benefit**: A benefit that lets you reduce the costs of your licences with Software Assurance.  
- **Azure Reservations**: A commitment discount that helps you save money by committing to one-year or three-year plans for multiple products.  
- **Azure Savings Plan for Compute**: A pricing model that offers discounts on compute services when you commit to a fixed hourly amount for one or three years.

Once you are familiar with these tools, map the tools and services to your organizational objectives, identify with are you currently using and which can potentially support with FinOps capabilities. Verify the remaining capabilities documentation to help you with this.

## üèóÔ∏è Building on the basics

Ensure that these practices become seamlessly integrated into your everyday processes, leveraging from automation. 
After implementing the tool or service, it's essential to conduct a thorough assessment. This involves comparing it to any alternative solutions that may emerge. By doing so, you can make informed decisions about its effectiveness and suitability for your needs.
