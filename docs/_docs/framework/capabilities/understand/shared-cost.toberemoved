**Managing shared cost refers to the process of redistributing the cost of shared services to the teams and applications that utilized them.**

## ‚úã Before you begin

Before you start, it's important to have a clear understanding of your organization's goals and priorities when it comes to managing shared costs. K

This guide doesn't cover commitment-based discounts, like reservations and savings plans. For details about how to handle showback and chargeback, refer to [Rate optimization](../optimize/rate-optimization.md).

<br>

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting started

When you first start managing cost in the cloud, you use the native allocation tools to manage shared costs. Start by identifying shared costs and how they should be handled.

- If your organization previously implemented the [Cost allocation capability](./allocation.md), refer back to any notes about unallocated or shared costs.
- Notify stakeholders that you're evaluating shared costs and request details about any known scenarios. Self-identification can save you significant time and effort.
- Review the services that have been purchased and are being used with the [Services view in Cost analysis](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/cost-analysis-built-in-views#break-down-product-and-service-costs).


<br>

## üèóÔ∏è Building on the basics

At this point, your simple cost allocation scenarios may be addressed. You're left with more complicated scenarios that require more effort to accurately quantify and redistribute. As you move beyond the basics, consider the following points:

- Establish and track common KPIs, like the percentage of unallocated shared costs.
- Consider using application telemetry to quantify the distribution of shared costs. It's discussed more in [Measuring unit costs](../quantify/unit-economics.md).
- Automate the process of identifying the percentage breakdown of shared costs and consider using allocation rules in Cost Management to redistribute the costs.
- Automate cost allocation rules to update their respective percentages based on changing usage patterns.
- Consider sharing targeted reporting about the distribution of shared costs with relevant stakeholders.
- Build a reporting process to raise awareness of and drive accountability for unallocated shared costs.
- Share guidance with stakeholders on how they can optimize shared costs.

## üçé Learn more at the FinOps Foundation

This capability is a part of the FinOps Framework by the FinOps Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing cloud cost management and optimization. For more information about FinOps, including useful playbooks, training and certification programs, and more, see the [Managing shared cost](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/manage-shared-cloud-cost/) article in the FinOps Framework documentation.
