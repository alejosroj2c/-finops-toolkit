## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting started

When you first start with cloud sustainability, there are a few built-in tools that can help you 

- To learn more about what environmental, social, and governance (ESG) capabilities Microsoft offers across the cloud portfolio and solutions, refer to the [Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability.](https://learn.microsoft.com/industry/sustainability/overview)
-Review the [Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability design principles](https://learn.microsoft.com/industry/well-architected/sustainability/cloud-sustainability-design-principles) outlined as part of the Well-Architected for Sustainability guidance.
- Use the [Azure carbon optimization](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/carbon-optimization/overview) to find opportunities to optimize your Azure environment to lower your carbon emissions and costs.
- Calculate your cloud-based carbon emissions with the [Emissions Impact Dashboard for Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/connect-data/service-connect-to-emissions-impact-dashboard) or the [Emissions Impact Dashboard for Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/connect-data/service-connect-to-emissions-impact-dashboard).
- Review the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability [reference architectures](https://learn.microsoft.com/industry/well-architected/sustainability/sustainability-architecture-overview) to identify which tools are more relevant for your environmental, social, and governance (ESG) capabilities.
<br>

## üèóÔ∏è Building on the basics

-Deploy the [Sustainability data solutions in Microsoft Fabric ](https://learn.microsoft.com/industry/sustainability/sustainability-data-solutions-overview) to help you ingest, harmonize, and process data for specific sustainability scenarios, such as ESG data estate, Microsoft Azure emissions insights, and Social and governance metrics and reports.
