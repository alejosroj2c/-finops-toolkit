Azure virtual machines (VMs) are one of several types of [on-demand, scalable computing resources that Azure offers](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/compute-decision-tree). Typically, you choose a virtual machine when you need more control over the computing environment than the other choices offer.

An Azure virtual machine gives you the flexibility of virtualization without having to buy and maintain the physical hardware that runs it. However, you still need to maintain the virtual machine by performing tasks, such as configuring, patching, and installing the software that runs on it.

## Understand cloud usage and cost

**Understanding and managing costs for virtual machines**

<!---
Add link to MS or F2 doc explaining the capability
-->
Azure VMs are a fundamental component of your cloud infrastructure, providing on-demand computing resources tailored to your specific needs. To effectively manage costs associated with VMs, it's crucial to understand the various factors that contribute to their pricing, as well as costs related to associated services.

<!---
Include a table with billing meters.
What are the billing meters that represents the cost of a VM? SKU, License (if windows), Storage, backup, monitoring etc 
-->

### Data ingestion

## Virtual machines:

- **Hourly billing:** VMs are billed based on the number of hours they are provisioned. The longer a VM runs, the higher the associated cost.
  <blockquote class="important" markdown="1">
     _A "Stopped" VM is still "provisioned" in the cloud and will incur charges. Make sure you "deallocate" your VMs to stop incurring compute charges. Other charges, like storage, are still applicable even in a deallocated state._
  </blockquote>

- **VM size:** The pricing of VMs varies based on the chosen size (SKU) or configuration. Larger and more powerful VMs generally incur higher costs.

- **Regional pricing:** The cost of a VM is influenced by the region where it is deployed. Different regions may have varying pricing structures, impacting the overall cost of VM usage. Additionally, it's worth noting that carbon emissions associated with cloud services, including VM usage, can also be region-specific. 

<!---
TODO: Include carbon emissions to the Cost Optimization advisor workbook
-->

- **VM states:** As VM instances transition through different states (running, stopped, deallocated), they may incur different billing rates. Ensure efficient VM management to minimize unnecessary costs during idle periods.

<!---
TODO: Add docs link
-->

## Storage:
<!---
TODO: Add docs link (pricing)
-->
- **Disk size:** Storage costs are determined by the size of disks attached to VMs, measured in gigabytes (GB). Larger disk sizes contribute to higher storage costs.

- **Transactions:** Transaction-based costs apply to storage and are influenced by the number of transactions per hour. Refer to the [storage billing documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-billing) for detailed information on transaction costs.

## Virtual network and bandwidth:
<!---
Add docs link (pricing)
-->
- **Virtual network data transfer:** Costs are associated with the amount of data transferred across virtual networks, measured in gigabytes (GB). Be mindful of data transfer volumes to optimize costs.

- **Bandwidth:** Similar to virtual network data transfer, bandwidth costs are based on the amount of data transferred. Efficient network management helps control bandwidth-related expenses.

## Associated services:
<!---
Add docs link (pricing)
-->

- **Azure monitor:** Costs for Azure Monitor are based on the volume of data ingested. Monitor and optimize the data ingested to manage associated expenses effectively.

- **Azure bastion:** Billing for Azure Bastion is determined by the volume of data transferred. Monitor and control data transfer to regulate costs.

- **Azure DNS:** Charges for Azure DNS depend on the number of DNS zones hosted and the quantity of DNS queries received. Manage DNS resources efficiently to control costs.

- **Load balancer:** If load balancers are utilized, costs are determined by the number of rulesets, hours used, and the amount of data processed. Optimize load balancer configurations for cost-effectiveness.

- **Backup:** Backup costs are associated with the chosen backup replication policy and frequency. Regularly assess and adjust backup strategies to align with cost-effectiveness and data recovery needs.

### Allocation

<!---
Add link to MS or F2 docs explaining the capability
-->

A highly effective method for grouping and allocating costs is through the tag inheritance feature in Cost Management. Enabled tag inheritance applies billing, resource group, and subscription tags to child resource usage records.

Once tag inheritance is enabled, tags from billing profiles, invoice sections, subscriptions, and resource groups are automatically applied to child resource usage records for the current month within 24 hours. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Cost allocation guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/enable-tag-inheritance).

#### Tagging best practices:

- **Consistent tagging:** Establish a consistent tagging strategy across VMs using the [Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-tagging).

Implementing tag inheritance and following these tagging best practices enhances your ability to efficiently allocate and manage VM costs.

### Reporting + analytics


<!---
Side note: Cost analysis has a feature where you can add a "cm-resource-parent" tag to your child resources (e.g., storage accounts) to link them to their logical parent and then Cost analysis will show the costs grouped together. We should inform them about this somewhere. It should be a separate doc that we reference probably in the reporting capability and possibly from here, if we end up calling out the issue.
-->


To report on VM costs comprehensively, consider all the services mentioned in the Data Ingestion capability, including but not limited to:

- **Virtual machines:** Understand the hourly billing, VM size, regional pricing, and states (running, stopped, deallocated).
- **Storage:** Factor in storage costs based on disk size and transactions per hour. 
- **Virtual network and bandwidth:** Include costs related to data transfer and bandwidth usage.
- **Associated services:** Consider costs associated with Azure Monitor, Azure Bastion, Azure DNS, and Load Balancer if used.

## Validating VM usage:

Once you've identified all the costs associated with a VM, the next crucial step is to validate the VM usage to ensure it is properly sized. This involves:

- **Right-sizing VMs:** Review the VM size to ensure it aligns with the actual workload requirements. Consider scaling up or down based on usage patterns.
- **Efficient resource management:** Leverage Azure services such as Cost Management and Azure Monitor to gain insights into VM performance metrics, allowing you to identify areas for optimization.


### Anomalies
<!---
