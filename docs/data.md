# Data dictionary

The following table describes the columns available within the exported data. The **Source** indicates whether the column is added in the Cost Management export, via a Data Factory transform, in Power Query (Power BI's query editor), or as a Power BI measure. Note we don't use calculated columns in Power BI due to complications with versioning.
