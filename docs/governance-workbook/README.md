## Governance
Microsoft Defender for Cloud continuously assesses your hybrid and multi-cloud workloads and provides you with recommendations to harden your assets and enhance your security posture.
Central security teams often experience challenges when driving the personnel within their organizations to implement recommendations. The organizations' security posture can suffer as a result.
We're introducing a brand-new, built-in governance experience to set ownership and expected remediation timeframes to resolve recommendations.
Pre-requisite: To use this governance report, you need to create security governance rules.
