## üìù FinOps Toolkit Contribution Guide

Welcome to the FinOps Toolkit project! As an open-source initiative, our success hinges on the collective effort of the community. Your contributions play a vital role in enhancing and expanding the toolkit's capabilities, making it more valuable and effective.

There are three primary ways you can contribute to the success of the project:

1. üêõ **Working on existing bugs:** You can assist by identifying and addressing existing bugs listed in our repository. 
2. üõ†Ô∏è **Suggesting and owning a new feature, fixing an existing bug, or suggesting a change for an existing tool:** This involves proposing new features, fixing bugs, or suggesting changes for existing tools. 
3. üí° **Submitting a proposal for a new tool:** If you've developed a FinOps-related tool and want it to be part of the FinOps Toolkit, you can submit a proposal for consideration.

We appreciate your interest in contributing to the FinOps Toolkit project!

### üêõ 1. Working on existing bugs

If you're eager to contribute but unsure where to begin, a great starting point is to review the list of existing feedback and identify issues that align with your skills and interests. 

1. Look through the list of existing bugs in the [Issues tab](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/FinOpsToolkit/issues).
2. Assign yourself to the bug you want to work on.

Once you are assigned to the bug, GitHub will automatically assign the tag "Community Contributor" to inform the team responsible for that tool of your contribution. Remember not to start coding until you receive approval from the governance team. 

<!---
Assuming we have a list of "approved" developers we could have a Github policy to auto-assign a tag if a bug is assigned to anyone else, right?

### üõ†Ô∏è 2. Suggesting and owning a new feature, fixing an existing bug, or suggesting a change for an existing tool

#### Submitting a New Issue and Willing to Fix

If you have a new feature suggestion, identified a bug, or have ideas for improving existing tools, we encourage you to submit an issue. Your feedback helps us ensure that the toolkit meets the needs of its users. And if you're willing to take it a step further and contribute to implementing your suggestions, we welcome your contributions with open arms! 

To do that, follow these steps: 

1. Go to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/FinOpsToolkit/issues) and click on "New issue".
2. Choose the option that best describes your contribution (bug fix, change request, or feature request).
3. Check the box "Willing to fix" at the bottom of the page.
4. Submit your issue.

Your issue will be reviewed by the FinOps Toolkit governance team, who will reach out to you to discuss further and give you the green light to start developing. Do not start coding before receiving approval from the governance team.

**Note:** Do not start coding before receiving approval from the governance team.

### 3. üí° Submitting a proposal for a new tool

If you have developed a FinOps-related tool and want it to be part of the FinOps Toolkit, follow these steps:

1. Send an email to [finpostoolkitgovcommittee@microsoft.com](mailto:finpostoolkitgovcommittee@microsoft.com) with your proposal.
2. Include as much information as possible about your tool and how it can benefit the FinOps community.

<!---
TODO: Create DL and add Governance committee members - BTW we can call the DL anyway we like, don't need to use the name that I added here
-->

The Toolkit governance committee will review your proposal and reach out to you for further discussion.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance with your contribution.
