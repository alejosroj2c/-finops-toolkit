## üìù FinOps Toolkit Contribution Guide

Welcome to the FinOps Toolkit project! As an open-source initiative, our success hinges on the collective effort of the community. Your contributions play a vital role in enhancing and expanding the toolkit's capabilities, making it more valuable and effective.

There are three primary ways you can contribute to the success of the project:

1. üêõ **Working on existing bugs:** You can assist by identifying and addressing existing bugs listed in our repository. 
2. üõ†Ô∏è **Suggesting and owning a new feature, fixing an existing bug, or suggesting a change for an existing tool:** This involves proposing new features, fixing bugs, or suggesting changes for existing tools. 
3. üí° **Submitting a proposal for a new tool:** If you've developed a FinOps-related tool and want it to be part of the FinOps Toolkit, you can submit a proposal for consideration.
4. üëÄ **Code review:** Code review is a critical aspect of maintaining code quality and ensuring the reliability and functionality of the project. By reviewing existing pull requests (PRs) suggested by community members, you can contribute significantly to the project's success without necessarily creating new code.
5. üí¨ **Answering questions:** Being actively involved in answering questions and providing assistance to community members is an invaluable contribution to the project.
6. üìö **Documentation update:** Documentation serves as a crucial resource for users, developers, and contributors alike. Keeping documentation accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date is essential for the success of the toolkit.

We appreciate your interest in contributing to the FinOps Toolkit project!

### üêõ 1. Working on existing bugs

If you're eager to contribute but unsure where to begin, a great starting point is to review the list of existing feedback and identify issues that align with your skills and interests. 

1. Look through the list of existing bugs in the [Issues tab](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/FinOpsToolkit/issues).
2. Assign yourself to the bug you want to work on.

If this is the first time you are working on the FinOps Toolkit repository, make sure to review our [Get Started Wiki.](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/wiki#-test-and-verify)

Once you are assigned to the bug, GitHub will automatically assign the tag "Community Contributor" to inform the team responsible for that tool of your contribution. 

### üõ†Ô∏è 2. Suggesting and owning a new feature, fixing an existing bug, or suggesting a change for an existing tool

#### Submitting a New Issue and Willing to Fix

If you have a new feature suggestion, identified a bug, or have ideas for improving existing tools, we encourage you to submit an issue. Your feedback helps us ensure that the toolkit meets the needs of its users. And if you're willing to take it a step further and contribute to implementing your suggestions, we welcome your contributions with open arms! 

To do that, follow these steps: 

1. Go to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/FinOpsToolkit/issues) and click on "New issue".
2. Choose the option that best describes your contribution (bug fix, change request, or feature request).
3. Check the box "Willing to fix" at the bottom of the page.
4. Submit your issue.

Your issue will be reviewed by the FinOps Toolkit governance team, who will reach out to you to discuss further and give you the green light to start developing. 

### 3. üí° Submitting a proposal for a new tool

If you have developed a FinOps-related tool and want it to be part of the FinOps Toolkit, follow these steps:

1. Send an email to [ftk-leads@microsoft.com](mailto:ftk-leads@microsoft.com) with your proposal.
2. Include as much information as possible about your tool and how it can benefit the FinOps community.

The FinOps toolkit governance committee will review your proposal and reach out to you for further discussion.


### 4. üëÄ **Code review**

- **Review Pull Requests:** Regularly check the list of open PRs on the repository and provide constructive feedback on code changes proposed by community members. Ensure that the code adheres to our [coding guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/wiki/Coding-guidelines.md), is well-documented, and follows best practices.

When possible, try to suggest code changes using **Add a suggestion** to streamline the review process.

<br>

- **Improve Quality:** Offer suggestions for improving the quality of the code, such as optimizing performance, enhancing readability, and addressing potential edge cases or bugs.

- **Validate Functionality:** Test the functionality of the code changes proposed in the PR to ensure they work as intended. This involves running tests, verifying edge cases, and checking for any unintended side effects.

### 5. üí¨ Answering Questions

Being actively involved in answering questions and providing assistance to community members is an invaluable contribution to the project.

- **Share Knowledge:** Utilize your expertise and experience to provide helpful and informative responses to questions raised by community members. Offer clear explanations, examples, and references to support your answers.

- **Help Resolve Issues:** Assist community members in troubleshooting technical issues, or resolving configuration problems they encounter while using the toolkit.

### 6. üìö Documentation Update:

- **Identify Areas for Improvement:** Review the existing documentation to identify any outdated information, inaccuracies, or gaps that need to be addressed.

- **Improve Clarity and Consistency:** Clarify ambiguous sections, reorganize content for better structure, and ensure consistency in terminology, formatting, and style throughout the documentation.

- **Update Content:** Update outdated information, add new content to cover recent features or changes, and remove obsolete sections that are no longer relevant.
