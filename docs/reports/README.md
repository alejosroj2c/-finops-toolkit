# FinOps toolkit reports

The FinOps toolkit hosts data in [Azure Data Lake Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction). You can use any tool to query and report on your cost data in storage. As an example, we've included the following Power BI reports to get you started. We recommend customizing them to keep what works, edit and augment reports with your own data, and remove anything that isn't needed.

> ℹ️ _The Power BI reports (PBIX files) are a starter kit. Keep in mind you won't be able to upgrade a customized report as the toolkit evolves._
